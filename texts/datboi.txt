History

According to Animation Factory employee Ryan Hagen, the frog GIF used in the meme was created by designer Josh Doohen.[4] Before becoming an Internet meme, the image was used in AP Physics 1 Essentials,[4] a textbook published in 2013.

The meme's name originates from an edited news screenshot[5] and the line of text often used in association with the image ("here come dat boi! o shit waddup!") was taken from a different meme featuring a computer-animated Pac-Man character.[5] The frog image and its caption were first put together on Facebook, according to Vox.[6] The Verge writer Chris Plante referred to the caption in a June article, stating that the Dat Boi image itself was "not enough" and should be paired with the caption.[7]

In May 2016, the "here come dat boi!" caption came under criticism after various Facebook users claimed to find it an "appropriation of African-American Vernacular English".[8][9] As a result, certain Facebook groups discouraged use of the meme.[10]

Dat Boi was featured in The Guardian's "Month in Memes" article for June 2016.[11] Matt Furie, creator of Pepe the Frog, explained in a June 2016 interview with Comic Book Resources that he was "devastated" to find out that Dat Boi had "begun to overshadow Internet Pepe".[12]
